To run the tailspin without gulp dependancy issue.
1) Install npm gulp globally.
2) Install gulp in the local folder.(npm install gulp)
3) npm install gulp --save-dev. Run this command.


If you have a library unresolved due to cdnjs, right click on libman.json then click on disable clients side packages.
This should work:)
